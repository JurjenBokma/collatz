# collatz
A bit of code to play with Github, Python, C++ and more

Largely following these tutorials:
https://realpython.com/python-bindings-overview/#pybind11
https://people.duke.edu/~ccc14/sta-663-2017/12B_C++_Python_pybind11.html

we make C++ functions available to Python.
That speeds the Collatz competition up by around a factor 30.
